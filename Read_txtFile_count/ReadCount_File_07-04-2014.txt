PROGRAM: 	Reads, Outputs and counts each individual line of a file: 
		3 variations of the same program at different programming levels
'''

'''
*

Reads every line from a  hardcoded file
or skips the first line
And, counts every line
'''

'''
count = 0

with open ('1a1e_C.txt') as f:
    #next(f) #skips first row
    f.readline(0)# use f.readline(0) if need the header or first row
    for line in f:
        count += 1
        print (line)

print ("\nCount: " + str(count))
'''

'''
**

As above, but the file is user input
'''

'''
InFile = input("Please enter the file name: ")

count = 0

with open (InFile) as f:
    #next(f) #skips first row
    f.readline(0)# use f.readline(0) if need the header or first row
    for line in f:
        count += 1
        print (line)

print ("\nCount: " + str(count))
'''

'''
***

As above, but has two subroutines or functions
